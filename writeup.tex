\section{Extension}
\subsection{Introduction}
    While I will agree that my writeup is particularly bad. I first want to say I put a lot of time into completing expr.ml, and evaluation.ml. I pretty didn't have time to do most of the extension. I spent over 20 hours doing this final project at least. Given the circumstances I hope you guys understand, I'm really did like this class, but I have issues going on at home so yeah.\\

\subsection{Addition}
\\
My addition was to allow for float operators. First what I had to do was edit my definition of expressions and binary operators in the expr.ml and corresponding mli file.\\

\\
Then what I had to do is edit the Binop match statement in evaluation.ml and change some of the definitions to include floats in the Env module.\\

\\
\\
Then I had to make many changes to both miniml\_lex.mll and miniml\_parse.mly. In I've attached what I've changed. Basically I had to add a new token that included floats, I also had to add new expressions to expnoapp, amending the hash table in the former file and telling the parser what floats actually are.
